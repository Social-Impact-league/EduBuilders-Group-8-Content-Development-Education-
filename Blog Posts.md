As we discussed in the previous blogs, Microsoft Power BI Desktop is a companion desktop application to Power BI. Letâ€™s discuss the installation process of Power BI Desktop.

It is available for both 32-bit(x86) and 64-bit(x64) platforms. To have smooth functionality, 2GB Ram and 1GHz CPUs are recommended.
