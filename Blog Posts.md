### Installation 

Power BI Desktop is built for data analysts. So, the tool empowers others with its capacity of creating and publishing reports to Power BI. As we discussed in the previous blogs, Microsoft Power BI Desktop is a companion desktop application to Power BI. Let’s discuss the installation process of Power BI Desktop.   

First, you need to have a window installed on the personal computer. The latest version of Power BI Desktop is supported for the following operating systems. 


* Windows 10 

* Windows Server 2012 R2 

* Windows Server 2012 

* Windows 8 

* Windows 8.1 

* Windows Server 2016 

* Windows Server 2019 

* Windows 11 

 

It is available for both 32-bit(x86) and 64-bit(x64) platforms. To have smooth functionality, 2GB Ram and 1GHz CPUs are recommended.  Apart from that I would recommend you have at least 1440x900 or 1600x900 (16:9) display resolution. It would enhance your user experience. Unfortunately, the software is not compatible with the Linux operating system. 

Step 1 : Download the version of Power BI Desktop that matches with your Windows OS. 

Step 2 : Run the EXE installer and follow the setup steps. 

Also, the Power BI Desktop is available for free in Microsoft Store for you to install.  

After successfully installing the application, the startup screen would be like this.

After signing into your account, you will get the screen below where you can see your recent reports. Then that is it.

Basically, this is the user interface of the Power BI Desktop. It seems more familiar to you, if you are an office package user. It consists of report view, data view and model view. Each view has unique features.
